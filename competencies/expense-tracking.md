# Competency - Expense Tracking

We spend money to run the business and all of it needs to be logged and accounted for. You will log all expenses and receipts in Drive. 

## How do you prove it?

Every receipt you acquire is catalogued in the Receipts folder in Drive. 

All expenses are forwarded to [invoices@sendwithus.com](mailto:invoices@sendwithus.com) for tracking

You track all expenses against current budgets and ensure you are not exceeding any budgets. 

## How do you improve it?

You don't just track expenses but you also look at projections for spending.

You proactively look at the monthly budgets and find areas to save money or increase ROI on purchases.
