# Competency - Language Python

Python is a dynamic language that uses spaces for structured blocks of code.  Python is most used for Data Engineering/Data Science and Web Development.

## How do you prove it?

For code you have submitted, your code reviews get little syntactic corrections.

You can write code from memory without having to look up how you use language specific features.

You can explain to someone the differences between this language and another language.

You can describe the kinds of problem the language solves very well and the problems it's not a great fit for.

You understand packaging paradigms for the language for both publishing and dependency management.

You have a good understanding of the resources and where to go if you're stuck.

You understand how third party libraries are used, accessed, their lifecycle and security implications.

## How do you improve it?

Do Google's python class: [https://developers.google.com/edu/python/](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/)

Write a lot of code

Read the PEP8 style guide: [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

## Key points of research

* Differences between Python 2 and 3

* Lambdas

* List and dictionary comprehensions

* async/await

* Global interpreter lock

* Pip (and other package managers)

* Virtualenv
