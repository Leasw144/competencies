# Competency - Product Knowledge

## How do you prove it?

Everyone in the organization considers you an expert in all aspects of the product.

You can clearly explain the motivations of the use-cases for every part of the product.

When triaging bugs you can easily figure out what parts of the system might be involved.

Acceptance tests show that you understand all aspects of how a feature will interact with other aspects of the system.

As someone who knows the product inside and out you can now write public product release notes.

nd attending meetings with customers to both hear feedback and discuss upcoming features in detail.
