# Competency - Cypress

Cypress is a front end testing tool built for the modern web applications. Cypress is most often compared to Selenium; however Cypress is both fundamentally and architecturally different. Cypress is not constrained by the same restrictions as Selenium. This enables you to write faster, easier and more reliable tests. Cypress can be used for end-to-end, integration, and unit tests.
