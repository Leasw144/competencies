# Competency - Language JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

* You can write code from memory without having to look up how you use language specific features.
* You can explain to someone the differences between this language and another language.
* You can describe the kinds of problem the language solves very well and the problems it's not a great fit for.
* You understand packaging paradigms for the language.
* You have a good understanding of the resources and where to go if you're stuck.
* You understand how third party libraries are used, access, their lifecycle and security implications.
