# Competency - Remote Work

As distinct from working from home, remote work is when you are peremenantly working from home.  Like during a pandemic. 

- Remote work is hard!  It requires a lot of discipline, time management, internal motivation.
- Remote work is glorious!  It gives you unprecedented, uninterrupted time to get work done, and you get to choose all the snacks.


## How do you prove it?

You have a fast, reliable internet connection/power, show us your speed test.
You have a quiet area to work free from interruptions and noise.
You are available on slack/email/etc... during work hours.  Available means different things to differnt roles, 
talk to your manager about their expectations for your availability.
You have a working headset and good audio.  In conference calls people don't tell you that you're breaking up or they can't hear you.
You are responsive to your colleagues.  Again, responsive means different things to different roles, check with your manager.
You can explain why you should switch to a video chat, as opposed to slack, as opposed to Asana.  When to use these mediums and when not to.
You know how to unblock your tasks and can describe who you go to in various situations.

## How do you improve it?

Plan your entire week to the best of your ability.  Planning allows you to remain focused, and not be distracted by the scores of personal 
projects at home.
Block off sections of your calendar to ensure you manage your weekly workload.  


Some examples of remote worker schedules.

On Sunday I review the week ahead, and check for meeting double bookings, and reschedule things that need to be.  
I pull in the work for the week that I hope to get done and schedule some large blocks of time in my calendar that I can do that work in.
Each day, I get up at 5:30am PST to be on time for the 9am start in EST, and as much overlap with Poland as possible.
I process all my inbound - capture task from slack / email into my task management in asana, and respond and unblock as many 
projects / people before the first meeting.
I check my calendar and make sure I have prep time for each meeting, if I don't I do the prep time as a first step in the day.
I check my task list for the weeks work and remind myself of the critical projects I'm responsible for.
In the first  gap in my calendar is where I take my shower, and I also use that time to think strategically about the rest of the day - 
"what is the best thing I could work on next".  As opposed to the morning where I have mostly been reactive and trying to unblock as many things as possible.
I finish my day at roughly 2pm but am available on slack till around 5pm for the rest of the team.
