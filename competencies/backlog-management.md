# Competency - Backlog Management

The backlog is the system where all near term / future parts of the product are recorded and prioritized.  Every team is responsible for ensuring that their backlog reflects the work that we want to be doing, and that each task is clear, groomed (or awaiting grooming), actionable, has a story owner and stakeholders, and is linked to the right supporting resources (specs, other tickets, design, epics, etc). 

Backlogs are prioritized according to what will have impact. 

Our backlogs are tracked in Asana

## How do you prove it?

Your working backlog has less than 100 items in it.  These are high level features/ideas that may break out into many user stories.

You have a system that separates out raw ideas and away from the backlog while still making sure everyone who had an idea feels heard.

The tickets capture who will use the feature and how they will be used.

Every ticket in the backlog has a high level estimate of value.

Every ticket in the backlog has a high level estimate of effort.

Each item in the top 25% is so well described (some people attach videos) that any ticket can be picked up by development and with no interaction with the product manager they can accurately assess the scope of work and every stakeholder that it benefits.

Every item in the top 25% has a set of acceptance criteria that lists off of the ways the product owner will enforce quality and completeness after development work is complete.

You hold client product roadmap meetings once a quarter that talk about the direction of the product.

You hold client roundtables once a quarter that gather feedback and generate new product ideas.  You use these sessions to get a feeling for relative importance of stories for clients.

* **Groom as you go**. When something comes to your from a stakeholder or at on call, groom it right away: add it to the right epic, add its priority, and ensure the contents of the ticket include everything so that whoever picks it up knows what "done" is. Also, ensure the ticket is prioritised in an upcoming sprint (see next points) or in the backlog. This will speed up the time it takes to groom with the team.

* **And, plan a sprint or two ahead**. This might be contentious, and that's okay. It may not work for all teams, and that's okay too. Create the next two sprints in Jira as placeholders and put in whatever didn't quite make into the last grooming session into there. Throughout the current sprint, add high value items to those future unconfirmed sprints.

    * Then, at grooming, you'll already have a list of impactful, high priority tickets to review as a team (which will save you having to comb through that ice box, or have people remember what might be important enough to work on this sprint). The whole team can be involved in this.
