# Competencies

This is a fork of the Sendwithus project that adds in roles and an application to manage employees careers backed by a google spreadsheet as a database.

## Roles
A role is a document describing a role and containing a list of competencies that are helpful in excelling in that role.

## Competencies

Each competency document is broken into three sections.

### Title and Description
A brief overview of what the skill is.  For example `Github` is the title of the competency and technology we use for version control.

### How do you prove it?
A section detailing how you would prove to your direct manager that you have this competency.  What is that manager going to look for to verify this skill.  This section is by far the most challenging as sometimes the task will be a technical skill that the manager doesn't have.  Or it might a soft skill like `One on Ones` that requires feedback from the employees team members.

### How do you improve it?
This is the section that lists of resources to improve this skill set.  This section tends to grow over time as tribal knowledge can be captured and stored here.

## Snippets
Snippets are sections of text that can be included in a role rather than copy/pasting the text in multilpe places.
