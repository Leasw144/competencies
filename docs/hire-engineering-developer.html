<strong>Engineering - Developer</strong><br><br>

<p>Welcome to SearchSpring, we&rsquo;re happy you&rsquo;re applying!  We think the most important thing about SearchSpring, about working
anywhere, in fact, is the people and how they interact.</p><br>

<p>At SearchSpring we foster an environment of caring, helpful, considerate and empathic people.  We think that&rsquo;s the best
environment to foster excellence and its one of the things we care most about in our hiring process.  If you are empathic and able to talk with humility and encourage others to thrive, we want to hear from you!</p><br>

<p>We don&rsquo;t want brilliance without empathy. We don&rsquo;t want creators who don&rsquo;t share. We don&rsquo;t want rock stars that
don&rsquo;t contribute to the community.</p><br>

<strong>What it&rsquo;s like to be a Developer</strong><br>

<p>As a developer, you spend the first few minutes of the day, reviewing your inbox, asana tasks, outstanding code reviews to make sure you’re not blocking anyone on your team.</p><br>

<p>You build code. When you are stuck, or needing to bounce ideas off another, you drag over a colleague to show off what you built and get feedback and input.  You are eager to accept feedback and improve your design of the code.  You demo to the product owner and deploy into production.  You do some documentation and write some more tests.  You have a discussion about tech choices.  You get stuck on something and ask for help.    You design something new and pull people up to the whiteboard to get to the bottom of it.</p><br>

<p>You find an issue you don’t know how to fix and you research intensely amassing information from tens of sources collating information and learning about the problem domain to ultimately make a decision about direction.  You show your decision to a trusted team member.</p><br>

<p>The following technologies are currently being used here, you don&rsquo;t need to know them all, but you should definitely know what they are.</p><br>

<p><strong>Coding:</strong> Java, Node.js, Clojure, Scala, PHP (legacy)</p><br>

<p><strong>Back End:</strong> ElasticSearch, MySQL, Redis, Glue, Redshift, RDS, Lambda, Spark</p><br>

<p><strong>Front End:</strong> Angular, Cypress.io, Mithril.js, Redux, Ospec, Karma, Jasmine</p><br>

<p><strong>DevOps:</strong> AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, Jenkins, Cloud Build, Sumologic</p><br>

<p>At SearchSpring, development teams are aligned behind a specific part of the product and we develop
software using Basecamp&rsquo;s Shape Up methodology.  <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">https://basecamp.com/shapeup</a>

adept and distributed working and familiar with the tools that facilitate this.</p><br>

<strong>Why you might like it</strong><br>

<p>You love learning new technologies and solving problems in novel ways.  You enjoy creating software with a teaem of peers.</p><br>

<strong>Why we might like you</strong><br>

<p>You enjoy working with others and helping mentor developers at all skill levels.  You are a strong communicator who takes the time to interact with people across different disciplines. You have a keen sense of community and are always looking for new ways to expand the work of others.</p><br>
