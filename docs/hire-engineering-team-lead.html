<strong>Engineering - Team Lead</strong><br><br>

<p>Welcome to SearchSpring, we&rsquo;re happy you&rsquo;re applying!  We think the most important thing about SearchSpring, about working
anywhere, in fact, is the people and how they interact.</p><br>

<p>At SearchSpring we foster an environment of caring, helpful, considerate and empathic people.  We think that&rsquo;s the best
environment to foster excellence and its one of the things we care most about in our hiring process.  If you are empathic and able to talk with humility and encourage others to thrive, we want to hear from you!</p><br>

<p>We don&rsquo;t want brilliance without empathy. We don&rsquo;t want creators who don&rsquo;t share. We don&rsquo;t want rock stars that
don&rsquo;t contribute to the community.</p><br>

<strong>What it&rsquo;s like to be a Team Lead</strong><br>

<p>We believe in a servant leadership, with team leads helping to enable their teams build the best software they can in the fastest and safest way possible.
Team leads are responsible for managing their team as well as leading them.  Leading the way in which software is built and helping the developers grow in their careers.
You set aside an hour a week for each of your direct reports, and in this 1:1 you discuss career development, work issues, life issues impacting work.
A portion of your monthly workload will be interviewing, screening and reference checks on candidates for SearchSpring.</p><br>

<p>The following technologies are currently being used here, you don&rsquo;t need to know them all, but you should definitely know what they are.</p><br>

<p><strong>Coding:</strong> Java, Node.js, Clojure, Scala, PHP (legacy)</p><br>

<p><strong>Back End:</strong> ElasticSearch, MySQL, Redis, Glue, Redshift, RDS, Lambda, Spark</p><br>

<p><strong>Front End:</strong> Angular, Cypress.io, Mithril.js, Redux, Ospec, Karma, Jasmine</p><br>

<p><strong>DevOps:</strong> AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, Jenkins, Cloud Build, Sumologic</p><br>

<p>At SearchSpring, development teams are aligned behind a specific part of the product and we develop
software using Basecamp&rsquo;s Shape Up methodology.  <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">https://basecamp.com/shapeup</a>
SearchSpring is split between five geographic areas in many different time zones so you will need to become
adept and distributed working and familiar with the tools that facilitate this.</p><br>

<strong>Why you might like it</strong><br>

<p>You want to build a successful team and look after the people in it. You enjoy working with people to achieve larger results than individuals could have on their own.</p><br>

<p>You&rsquo;re not afraid of dealing with conflict, and can approach difficult situations with candor and humility.</p><br>

<p>You have strong technical and analytical skills, with an advanced knowledge of computer software languages, platforms and current methodologies.  You&rsquo;re excited to share this knowledge with others, and constantly set a good example with solid software engineering principles.</p><br>

<strong>Why we might like you</strong><br>

<p>You enjoy working with others and helping mentor developers at all skill levels.  You are a strong communicator who takes the time to interact with people across different disciplines. You have a keen sense of community and are always looking for new ways to expand the work of others.</p><br>
