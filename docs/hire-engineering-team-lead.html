<h1>Engineering - Team Lead</h1>

<h2>What it&rsquo;s like to be a team lead</h2>

<p>We believe in a servant leadership, with team leads helping to enable their teams build the best software they can in the fastest and safest way possible.
Team leads are responsible for managing their team as well as leading them.  Leading the way in which software is built and helping the developers grow in their careers.</p>

At SearchSpring, development teams are aligned behind a specific part of the product and we develop 
software using Basecamp's Shape Up methodology.  https://basecamp.com/shapeup
</div>

<p>SearchSpring is split between five geographic areas in many different time zones so you will need to become adept and distributed working and familiar with the tools that facilitate this.
You set aside an hour a week for each of your direct reports, and in this 1:1 you discuss career development, work issues, life issues impacting work.
A portion of your monthly workload will be interviewing, screening and reference checks on candidates for SearchSpring.</p>

<h3>Why you might like it</h3>

<p>You want to build a successful team and look after the people in it. You enjoy working with people to achieve larger results than individuals could have on their own.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re not afraid of dealing with conflict, and can approach difficult situations with candor and humility.</p>

<p>You have strong technical and analytical skills, with an advanced knowledge of computer software languages, platforms and current methodologies.  You&rsquo;re excited to share this knowledge with others, and constantly set a good example with solid software engineering principles.</p>

<h3>Why we might like you</h3>

<p>You enjoy working with others and helping mentor developers at all skill levels.  You are a strong communicator who takes the time to interact with people across different disciplines. You have a keen sense of community and are always looking for new ways to expand the work of others.</p>

<h2>What you need</h2>

<p>At SearchSpring we use a competency based management system to hire and train people.<br />
For this role there are skills that you are expected to have and skills that you will be expected to learn.
Each of the skills  below link to a github page describing that skill, and how you learn it, and how we
expect you to prove that you have it.  Some of these maybe not be 100% filled in - please feel free to create a
pull request and submit how you think this skill should be defined.</p>

<h3>Expected to have at least 50% of these and learn the rest</h3>
